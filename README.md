# 🚨 Alarm Manager – Foreground Service Triggered from Background

This is a simple experimental Android project that demonstrates **starting a foreground service from the background** using **AlarmManager** and showing a **notification**.

While this may sound straightforward, **trust me — finding a working example like this on the internet is nearly impossible**. Not even AI tools provide a complete and functional implementation. I’ve spent **days and days** researching and debugging to get this to work seamlessly.

## ✨ What this project offers

- Starts a **foreground service** from the **background** and detect the current location using `AlarmManager`
- Displays a **simple notification**
- Implemented in the **most minimal and clean way possible**
- Helps you **bypass common pitfalls** that aren’t covered well in official or community resources

> ✅ **Note**: The app requires multiple runtime permissions, which are not handled in this example.  
> To keep the code as clean and focused as possible, you’ll need to **grant all necessary permissions manually** from the device settings.
